  <p>People: a decision has been made.</p>
  <h1>I am rebranding Ahnablog.</h1>
  <p>For some time now, I've been struggling to keep up with this blog. I just wasn't sure how I felt about what I was doing. There were a lot of mixed feelings. Responsibility, uncertainty... guilt. So, after a lot of thinking, I've decided that the best way to deal with this problem is to give the blog a big makeover.<br>
So many things about this blog are going to change. New theme, new content, new features... Almost every aspect of it will be subject to the rebranding! However, the one thing that I hope never changes is this blog's ability to help and inspire others. I will always want that to be a constant in my life and the things in it. The biggest aspect of this blog that is going to change is the amount of personality in it. I've been leaning towards this direction for a while now, but never fully committed to it. Now, I'm going to really put the Ahna in Ahnablog. Instead of a blog that focuses on giving lifestyle tips and advice, Ahnablog will detail my personal journey towards a balanced lifestyle - tips still included!<br>
Because I am currently in school again and this rebranding project will take quite a bit of work, I don't expect to be fully done making changes until at least the start of March. I can promise you that the new Ahnablog era will begin on March 15th. (So, beware!)
In the meantime, feel free to share your thoughts and concerns about the rebranding. Though this blog will be under construction for some time, I am still open to answering any questions you may have.
